# Linux Termainal Journal
This repository is a personal record of my hands-on Linux practice. I'm currently learning the basics of the Linux command line as part of my journey into cloud computing and DevOps.

I started this journal to stay consistent, track my daily progress, and slowly build comfort with terminal-based tasks — even if it’s just a few commands a day.

---

## What I'm Practicing
- Navigating directories (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`)
- Managing files and folders (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`)
- Understanding and changing permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Using simple aliases
- Keeping logs with `nano`
- Archiving and compressing files (up next)

---

## Daily Progress Logs
All my daily practice and notes are logged in [`logs/manual_log.txt`](logs/manual_log.txt).  
Each entry is dated, and I try to reflect on what I learned that day — even if it’s something small.

## Why I Made This
I’m a CS student who is in the first year of college. Since I’m aiming for a career in cloud computing, I’ve been slowly building my fundamentals. I created this repo to:

- Document what I practice daily
- Learn Git and version control along the way
- Build discipline and consistency over perfection

---

## What's Next ?
- Archiving & compression (tar, zip, gzip)
- User and group management
- Shell scripting basics
- Automating daily tasks
- CI/CD introduction (once I learn Node.js)

---

## This is just the beginning
I'm still new to all this — and I'm learning by doing. If you're also learning, feel free to fork this and use it for your own practice.
